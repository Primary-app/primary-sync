### "I'm new here, what does Primary do?" 👶

*Primary is an app for creating design documents and user flows that your whole team will understand.*

It's easy to get started with our user flow builder and then showcase them to anyone with our Presentation view. There's also a powerful document export tool to generate and share your designs as markdown or requirements.

If you're still communicating your designs through comments on images then [Primary](https://www.primary.app/?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=sync&utm_campaign=4) was made for you!
